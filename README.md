**Project 5: Nutrical : McDonald&amp;#39;s Menu Nutritional Analysis**

**By : Madhushree Joshi**

Project Description:
McDonald's is a global fast-food chain known for its diverse menu offerings. As a data analyst, i am trying to analyze the nutritional content of the menu items available at McDonald's outlets. This analysis will provide valuable insights into the calorie count and nutrition facts of various menu items.

Data set name used : Nutrical Dataset.csv

**Recommendations for McDonald:**
1) Regularly assess and update the menu to incorporate healthier options
2) Continue to improve the nutritional profile of menu items.
3) Breakfast items needs to be more healthier by introducing items with more nutrition content.
4) Need to reduce Sugar levels in the food items which is toxic.
5) MCDolands can come up with food items with more good fat and reduce colestrol.
